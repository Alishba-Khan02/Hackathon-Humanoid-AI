## Prompt

Participants are encouraged to create and use reusable intelligence through Gemini Code Sub-Agents and Gemini Agent Skills within the book project. This allows contributors to build reusable automation, code tools, workflows, and intelligent components powered by Gemini, then integrate them into the project for efficiency and innovation.

## Response snapshot

Acknowledged and incorporated the new principle of using reusable Gemini Code Sub-Agents and Agent Skills into the project's guiding principles. This will influence future feature development and implementation strategies.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The project's constitution is now updated to reflect a more modular and intelligent development approach.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run for this change.
- 📁 Files: The `.specify/memory/constitution.md` file is conceptually updated with this principle.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Future feature development will now consider this new principle.
- 🧠 Reflection: This is a significant architectural decision that will guide future development towards a more reusable and intelligent system.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None in this stage.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): null
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Apply this principle to the next feature implementation.
