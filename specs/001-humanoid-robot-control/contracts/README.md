# Contracts

This directory serves as a placeholder for API contracts. For this project, which focuses on educational documentation for Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics, formal API contracts (e.g., OpenAPI, GraphQL schemas) are not being generated.

Instead, the "contracts" are defined conceptually through:
-   **Functional Requirements**: Outlining expected behaviors and interactions between system components (e.g., ROS 2 nodes, simulation environments, LLMs, physical robots).
-   **Data Model**: Describing the key entities and their relationships within the educational content.
-   **Documentation**: Detailed explanations of communication protocols, interfaces, and integration patterns within the course modules themselves.
