-   **Docusaurus**: A static site generator that helps you build, deploy, and maintain open-source project websites easily.

## E

-   **Edge Computing**: Processing data near the source of data generation (the "edge" of the network), rather than sending it to a centralized cloud or data center.
-   **Embodied Intelligence**: AI systems that are physically situated in the real world (e.g., robots) and interact with their environment through sensors and actuators.

## G

-   **Gazebo**: A powerful open-source 3D robot simulator that accurately and efficiently simulates populations of robots in complex indoor and outdoor environments.

## H

-   **Humanoid Robot**: A robot with its overall body shape built to resemble the human body, typically with a torso, a head, two arms, and two legs.

## I

-   **IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)**: An electronic device that measures and reports a body's specific force, angular rate, and sometimes the magnetic field surrounding the body, using a combination of accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers.
-   **NVIDIA Isaac Sim**: A scalable robotics simulation application and synthetic data generation tool built on NVIDIA Omniverse, providing high-fidelity physics and realistic rendering.

## J

-   **JetPack SDK**: NVIDIA's comprehensive software development kit for Jetson embedded systems, providing libraries, APIs, tools, and developer resources.
-   **Jetson Kit**: A compact, high-performance, low-power embedded computing platform from NVIDIA, designed for AI and deep learning applications at the edge.

## K

-   **Kinematics**: The branch of mechanics concerned with the motion of objects without reference to the forces that cause the motion. In robotics, forward and inverse kinematics describe robot joint and end-effector positions.

## L

-   **Large Language Model (LLM)**: A type of artificial intelligence program that can recognize and generate text, among other tasks, after being trained on vast datasets of text and code.
-   **Locomotion**: The act or power of moving from place to place. In robotics, it refers to the methods by which a robot moves.

## M

-   **Manipulation**: The control of a robot's end-effector (e.g., a gripper) to interact with and move objects in the environment.
-   **Markdown**: A lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor.

## N

-   **Navigation**: The process by which a robot determines its position, plans a path to a target, and executes movement to reach that target.
-   **NVIDIA Omniverse**: A platform for connecting and building custom 3D pipelines and simulating large-scale virtual worlds.

## O

-   **OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)**: An open-source computer vision and machine learning software library.

## P

-   **Physical AI**: The field of artificial intelligence concerned with intelligent systems that interact with the physical world through perception and action.
-   **PyTorch**: An open-source machine learning framework known for its flexibility and dynamic computation graph, widely used for deep learning applications.
-   **Python**: A high-level, interpreted programming language widely used in AI, machine learning, and robotics for its readability and extensive libraries.

## R

-   **Real-time Control**: A system's ability to respond to external events or data within a specified, often very short, time frame.
-   **Reproducibility**: The ability to obtain the same results from an experiment or computational procedure when using the same input data, methods, and code.
-   **Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2)**: An open-source set of software libraries and tools that help you build robot applications. It provides services like hardware abstraction, device drivers, inter-process communication, and package management.

## S

-   **Sensor**: A device that detects and responds to some type of input from the physical environment (e.g., light, heat, motion, pressure), and converts it into a signal that can be read by an instrument.
-   **Sim-to-Real Transfer**: The process of training or developing AI models and control policies in simulation and then deploying them successfully on physical robots.
-   **Simulation**: The imitation of the operation of a real-world process or system over time.
